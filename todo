!timeout function won't work if you try to send values to the callback

newline characters don't work for the generated response text for whatever reason

reset button down behavior after time out (once you figure out how timeout works..)

change "about" to "back" and also the behavior so that you can go back from the about page without starting a game or hitting reset
