!really strange behavior:
    AI rarely picks paper when you pick rock continuously
    Sometimes it displays paper when the AI picked scissors
    User icons don't change

newline characters don't work for the generated response text for whatever reason

timeout code doesn't work for hey()

potentially add some kind of button down behavior that times out (once you figure out how timeout works..)

change "about" to "back" and also the behavior so that you can go back from the about page without starting a game or hitting reset
