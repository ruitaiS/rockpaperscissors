This is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game I made as part of the Odin Project.

The biggest takeaway I had from this was how much the color palette can change the tone of a webpage. The original color scheme was atrocious. I really need to thank my friend Penelope for picking out a different one for me - it instantly gave the game a much more playful personality. After that it kind of took on a life of it's own and everything else just fell into place.
